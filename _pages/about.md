## About Me

TS:WM (Too Short: Want More) - You want a more full break down, check out my [personal website](https://www.alexanderlyons.net/).

I've always like cooking and food ever since I was a kid. 
I got started baking in college thanks to [Yakitate!! Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakitate!!_Japan). 
My roommate and I made the rice cooker bread randomly. 
Our RA was livid, because he swore we had to have some kind of oven in our room. 

From there, I've taken to making food and feeding people as a way to show my love and appreciation. 
From being subscribed to many YouTube cooking channels to buying fun and silly cook books, I love to take an afternoon and just make something new.
I think I am best at baking, though my cooking isn't far behind. 
If I could, I wouldn't mind retiring to a restaurant cook job, something that served lunch and dinner til about 9 pm. 
I know it sounds like a lot, but definitely would be cool and a great way to stay active after I get out of the standard 9 to 5. 

### Outside of Cooking & Eating

#### Video Games

Video games are probably my primary passion, even past cooking! 
It's the best way for me and a lot of my friends to stay in touch and we love getting together online and just goofing around.
Right now, my big games are Final Fantasy XIV (yes, I am going to max Culinarian), Steam World Dig 2, and Beat Saber. 
That being said, I am all over the place when it comes to playing games, though I definitely am more into JRPGs, platformers, and racing games.
Also factory building games... but we try to limit those, since they eat away at a lot of time. 

#### Table Top Games

I love board games and role playing games too. 
I play some board games when I can with friends. 
I am currently in a D&D 4E campaign and am preparing to run a D&D 5E game of Tomb of Annihilation. 
Also, I am working on a couple of things in the background when I am feeling it, but those will be posted about elsewhere.

#### Programming
