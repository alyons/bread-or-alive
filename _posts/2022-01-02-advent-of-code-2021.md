Whoo! My first year completing Advent of Code! In a new language to boot!

This year was pretty cool, and I was excited to try a new language (to me), especially one as powerful as Python. I worked in v3.10 and got to play with all of the latest and coolest features that I could figure out, even setting up virtual environments and testing (we aren't going to talk about the fall off of testing as the challenge went on). I do miss the problem in 2019 where we built up a program over the calendar and it continued to evolve.

Also, this is the first year I was able to implement a* just from the Wikipedia page, rather than having to look up endless videos on how to do it. Not sure why, but my brain enters the 9th level of fuzz when I try to think about algorithms for too long.

I would love to have finished before the end of the 2021, but getting the last star on the 1st of this year was pretty cool.

Next year, I actually want to do it in Python again, see if I can keep up my skills, translate other years into Python, play with the rich module to make CLIs and really lean into what I can do with Python. Since I normally do DevOps or web dev, Advent of Code is always a fun way to push the limits of my coding, problem solving, and understanding of the limitations of whatever computer I am on to make it work how I would like.
