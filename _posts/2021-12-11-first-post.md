Hey there! I am planning on trying to cook recipes all throughout next year and post about it.
If I can, I want to make sure to get better pictures, and really work at understanding how my cooking works.
Throwing it up on GitHub Pages will make it so its simple to post about it and I should be able to even do it from home.

I have loved cooking for a while and now with a better kitchen and more knowledge, this should be a fun endeavor.
