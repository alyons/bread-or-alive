Okay, so I was planning on trying and doing this once a week, but hey, things don't always work out as planned.
So, what have I been up to?
Pretty much, doing too many things, and none of them are reaching any sort of completion, but they are engaging me.
The quick list:

- Two Pygame Projects, one of which I will talk about here.
- Working on my different websites a little at a time.
- Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel
- Streaming four days a week

## Pygame

So, I don't know how many people know this about me, but I almost got a degree in Game Design instead of Computer Science.
I decided against it because I felt like I wanted to do more normal dev work and the game industry even then didn't have a great track record for employee treatment.
For one of my senior projects, my friend Roy and I, along with another classmate, created a game called Sudoquest.
This was based off of Puzzle Quest, an RPG with combat based on Match 3 gameplay.
We felt that type of gameplay was bad because it was too random, and decided that Sudoku could provide the needed touch to make it a proper puzzle.

This year, given I picked up Python, I started playing with Pygame, for the fun of it and while scrolling through my old repos, I stumbled on the original Sudoquest.
I talked to Roy about it and we are going to see if we can get it reworked a touch and reimplemented.

This also lead to me building a small module I am calling Pygame Roar, which is simply a rebuild of the GameStateManagementSample from Microsoft.
This will allow me to crank out other games more quickly and really enjoy building systems in Python.

## All the Different Websites

### Extra Life Slalom Atlanta

Been dabbling with the migration to MUI v5 and of course, have found various bugs in the live version as different endpoints and API have closed down.
Now I have to update the internal api to handle Twitch v5 and MUI v5, so this will be fun.

### Personal Website / Portfolio

I am rebuilding my personal website, and doing it with love and what not.
Trying to focus on designing different components before I build them, using Figma to really hash around with different ideas.

### Bread or Alive

Yeah, kind of forgot to be blogging. Going to try and do that more often.

## Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel

I saw an opportunity to be Seto Kaiba, and I took it.

## Streaming

So Monday through Thursday, I am streaming the various games.
Right now, Monday and Wednesday are kind of free floating, and Tuesday and Thursday are Divinity: Original Sin 2 nights.
I am certain we are the good guys, but only because everyone else is trash.
Like I am pretty sure the next best group of people (save random townsfolk), are racist slavers?
Cause the people rounding up random people and killing them at least aren't racists?
And technically are correct about certain events happing in the world, but misunderstand the cause and effect.
Divinity is a weird game...

## Backlogged Projects

So I do have a few other projects I have been working on, but they have stalled or need just a touch more work to get to where I can work on them a bit more.

**Shards of the Crystal Braves** - I am working on a character sheet and really need to solidify the stats before we can continue on this.

**Megaman.EXE Battle Network the Board Game** - I have the prototype player decks, I am currently working on the enemy and boss cards, and trying to determine the best way to set things up to make the game fun, without going too hard on mechanics.
